* playing with fonts, and you do not have t type all the fonts on your css stylesheet, you can simply generate font face style sheet from [Transfonter]https://transfonter.org/
* nice day, sunny
* and flexbox, THE FLEXBOX! I wish I knew about it earlier. Also mobile-first. I will wipe out my whole project page and rewrite it because reversing the css with media queries is too painful right now. Happy me, yay!
* also, my son is bringing friend over. Two hours of two 5 years old boys. Lucky me, yay yay!

cheers,
Kate
