* Project work day all day. I like finishing the Instanews Project. I am aware that there so much to correct and make better (I actually wrote down in the READEME file what needs to be corrected), but I am glad to leave it for now and move to other project. I will schedule time for polishing once the feedback from teacher comes. Done s better than prefect, right? (do not tell that to designers ;).
* I wanna work on weather app so it changes background depends on the weather. An play some music from Spotify. I need to read more about putting two APIs together.
* What's pong game? I've learnt yesterday :)

cheers,
Kate
