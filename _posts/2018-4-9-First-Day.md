Here will be the first experience of Web Dev at Red Academy. First day is about getting to know each other, look around, getting familiar with.
At the Web Dev part, we were having fun trying to figure out some problem solving concepts and apply them to creating an app, that could solve one of humanity problems...

... and then my son's school ran. I needed to run.
They never call, but of course something just must happen on my first day of school.

Cheers,
Kate
