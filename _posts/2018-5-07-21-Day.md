* JavaScript is weird. Why Nan === Nan is not true? All that funny stuff we covered today. It was really good day. Note to myself: before this kind of class, get more sleep, Kate!
* Also, sent my first resume as an inspiring web developer / project manager. If anyone reads it, please keep your fingers crossed.

cheers,
Kate
