All day long jquery. And this song from Code School, is just popping in my head all day long too ;)..... write less, do more...
* I cannot decide yet, whether it is actually less typing. 200+ methods that's a lot to remember. And all that siblings, and parents, well, let's just say, it is bog family to take care of.
* Practicing my jquery with Red lab activity: making to-do list. My husband was patiently waiting until I finish, but... I finished and he felt asleep (ergo, it took longer, than I expected. Hehehe). My to-do is on Github (and looks bad, I know, Bootstrap it maybe some day?)
