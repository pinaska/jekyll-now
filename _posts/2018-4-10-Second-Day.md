* everything you should know about CSS
* I am not using Visual Code studio editor (feeling like typing goes faster in Atom, for me, for now)
* absolutely have now idea what position absolute is for
* after 2 years first time biking in rain and getting soaked totally. Question from my 5y son: why did you not drive a car?

I feel like I am missing something, like everything probably.... and yes, it is just third day.
Anyway, I started coding layout for other website, a simple psd file based one. Because if I will stare for the whole day at the project 01 files I might as well get crazy right away.
Plus I did not do any JS from 4 days, buuuuuu.
And I am hosting playdate tomorrow, lucky mommy...

cheers,
Kate
