* Basic html
* Visual Code studio editor (so far I've been using Atom)
* checking out some nice CSS kitten on codepen
ad it was raining like crazy.
We were learning basics at a good pace, so all group felt quite comfortable. In the meantime we were working on our project, that's due in 2 weeks.
I managed to layout the structure and basic css. Started on making flexbox gallery. Some of use are using css grid to that.
Something new - standup meetings at the end of class, based on scrum concept. Nice to have a team meeting again....

cheers,
Kate
