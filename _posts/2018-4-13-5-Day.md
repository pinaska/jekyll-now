* and it is raining again buuuu,
* time to work with Command Line and Git. And yes, it is working on Windows :) So far, I was working with Github Client and using Git built with Atom. Command line makes more sense though (less clicking, thank you tab key). Just need to get used to this fancy look (how to customize it anyway?)

cheers,
Kate
